DESCRIPTION = "N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python"
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
**xarray** (formerly **xray**) is an open source project and Python package
that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple,
efficient, and fun!

Multi-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called
"tensors") are an essential part of computational science.
They are encountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,
geoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning.
In Python, NumPy_ provides the fundamental data structure and API for
working with raw ND arrays.
However, real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers;
they have labels which encode information about how the array values map
to locations in space, time, etc.

By introducing *dimensions*, *coordinates*, and *attributes* on top of raw
NumPy-like arrays, xarray is able to understand these labels and use them to
provide a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone experience.
Xarray also provides a large and growing library of functions for advanced
analytics and visualization with these data structures.
Xarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas_, the popular data
analysis package focused on labelled tabular data.
Xarray can read and write data from most common labeled ND-array storage
formats and is particularly tailored to working with netCDF_ files, which were
the source of xarray's data model.
