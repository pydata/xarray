# NUMFOCUS CODE OF CONDUCT

You can find the full Code of Conduct on the NumFOCUS website: https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct

## THE SHORT VERSION

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
