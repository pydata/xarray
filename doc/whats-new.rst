v0.4.1 (unreleased)
-------------------

The release contains bug fixes and backwards compatible changes.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :py:meth`~xray.Dataset.resample` lets you resample a dataset or data array to
  a new temporal resolution. The syntax is the `same as pandas`_, except you
  need to supply the time dimension explicitly:

  .. ipython:: python

      time = pd.date_range('2000-01-01', freq='6H', periods=10)
      array = xray.DataArray(np.arange(10), [('time', time)])
      array.resample('1D', dim='time')

  You can specify how to do the resampling with the ``how`` argument and other
  options such as ``closed`` and ``label`` let you control labeling:

  .. ipython:: python

      array.resample('1D', dim='time', how='sum', label='right')

  If the desired temporal resolution is higher than the original data
  (upsampling), xray will insert missing values:

  .. ipython:: python

      array.resample('3H', 'time')

- ``first`` and ``last`` methods on groupby objects let you take the first or
  last examples from each group along the grouped axis:

  .. ipython:: python

      array.groupby('time.day').first()

  These methods combine well with ``resample``:

  .. ipython:: python

      array.resample('1D', dim='time', how='first')

.. _same as pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#up-and-downsampling

TODO: write full docs on time-series!

v0.4 (2 March, 2015)
--------------------

This is one of the biggest releases yet for xray: it includes some major
changes that may break existing code, along with the usual collection of minor
enhancements and bug fixes. On the plus side, this release includes all
hitherto planned breaking changes, so the upgrade path for xray should be
smoother going forward.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We now automatically align index labels in arithmetic, dataset construction,
  merging and updating. This means the need for manually invoking methods like
  :py:func:`~xray.align` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex_like` should be
  vastly reduced.

  :ref:`For arithmetic<math automatic alignment>`, we align
  based on the **intersection** of labels:

  .. ipython:: python

      lhs = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], [('x', [0, 1, 2])])
      rhs = xray.DataArray([2, 3, 4], [('x', [1, 2, 3])])
      lhs + rhs

  :ref:`For dataset construction and merging<merge>`, we align based on the
  **union** of labels:

  .. ipython:: python

      xray.Dataset({'foo': lhs, 'bar': rhs})

  :ref:`For update and __setitem__<update>`, we align based on the **original**
  object:

  .. ipython:: python

      lhs.coords['rhs'] = rhs
      lhs

- Aggregations like ``mean`` or ``median`` now skip missing values by default:

  .. ipython:: python

      xray.DataArray([1, 2, np.nan, 3]).mean()

  You can turn this behavior off by supplying the keyword arugment
  ``skipna=False``.

  These operations are lightning fast thanks to integration with bottleneck_,
  which is a new optional dependency for xray (numpy is used if bottleneck is
  not installed).
- Scalar coordinates no longer conflict with constant arrays with the same
  value (e.g., in arithmetic, merging datasets and concat), even if they have
  different shape (:issue:`243`). For example, the coordinate ``c`` here
  persists through arithmetic, even though it has different shapes on each
  DataArray:

  .. ipython:: python

      a = xray.DataArray([1, 2], coords={'c': 0}, dims='x')
      b = xray.DataArray([1, 2], coords={'c': ('x', [0, 0])}, dims='x')
      (a + b).coords

  This functionality can be controlled through the ``compat`` option, which
  has also been added to the :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` constructor.
- Datetime shortcuts such as ``'time.month'`` now return a ``DataArray`` with
  the name ``'month'``, not ``'time.month'`` (:issue:`345`). This makes it
  easier to index the resulting arrays when they are used with ``groupby``:

  .. ipython:: python

      time = xray.DataArray(pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=365),
                            dims='time', name='time')
      counts = time.groupby('time.month').count()
      counts.sel(month=2)

  Previously, you would need to use something like
  ``counts.sel(**{'time.month': 2}})``, which is much more awkward.
- The ``season`` datetime shortcut now returns an array of string labels
  such `'DJF'`:

  .. ipython:: python

      ds = xray.Dataset({'t': pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=12, freq='M')})
      ds['t.season']

  Previously, it returned numbered seasons 1 through 4.
- We have updated our use of the terms of "coordinates" and "variables". What
  were known in previous versions of xray as "coordinates" and "variables" are
  now referred to throughout the documentation as "coordinate variables" and
  "data variables". This brings xray in closer alignment to `CF Conventions`_.
  The only visible change besides the documentation is that ``Dataset.vars``
  has been renamed ``Dataset.data_vars``.
- You will need to update your code if you have been ignoring deprecation
  warnings: methods and attributes that were deprecated in xray v0.3 or earlier
  (e.g., ``dimensions``, ``attributes```) have gone away.

.. _bottleneck: https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex` with a fill method. This
  provides a useful shortcut for upsampling:

  .. ipython:: python

      data = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims='x')
      data.reindex(x=[0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5], method='pad')

  This will be especially useful once pandas 0.16 is released, at which point
  xray will immediately support reindexing with
  `method='nearest' <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/9258>`_.
- Use functions that return generic ndarrays with DataArray.groupby.apply and
  Dataset.apply (:issue:`327` and :issue:`329`). Thanks Jeff Gerard!
- Consolidated the functionality of ``dumps`` (writing a dataset to a netCDF3
  bytestring) into :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` (:issue:`333`).
- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` now supports writing to groups in netCDF4
  files (:issue:`333`). It also finally has a full docstring -- you should read
  it!
- :py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` now
  work on netCDF3 files when netcdf4-python is not installed as long as scipy
  is available (:issue:`333`).
- The new :py:meth:`Dataset.drop <xray.Dataset.drop>` and
  :py:meth:`DataArray.drop <xray.DataArray.drop>` methods makes it easy to drop
  explicitly listed variables or index labels:

  .. ipython:: python

      # drop variables
      ds = xray.Dataset({'x': 0, 'y': 1})
      ds.drop('x')

      # drop index labels
      arr = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], coords=[('x', list('abc'))])
      arr.drop(['a', 'c'], dim='x')

- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.broadcast_equals` has been added to correspond to
  the new ``compat`` option.
- Long attributes are now truncated at 500 characters when printing a dataset
  (:issue:`338`). This should make things more convenient for working with
  datasets interactively.
- Added a new documentation example, :ref:`monthly means example`. Thanks Joe
  Hamman!

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Several bug fixes related to decoding time units from netCDF files
  (:issue:`316`, :issue:`330`). Thanks Stefan Pfenninger!
- xray no longer requires ``decode_coords=False`` when reading datasets with
  unparseable coordinate attributes (:issue:`308`).
- Fixed ``DataArray.loc`` indexing with ``...`` (:issue:`318`).
- Fixed an edge case that resulting in an error when reindexing
  multi-dimensional variables (:issue:`315`).
- Slicing with negative step sizes (:issue:`312`).
- Invalid conversion of string arrays to numeric dtype (:issue:`305`).
- Fixed``repr()`` on dataset objects with non-standard dates (:issue:`347`).

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``dump`` and ``dumps`` have been deprecated in favor of
  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf`.
- ``drop_vars`` has been deprecated in favor of :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.drop`.

Future plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The biggest feature I'm excited about working toward in the immediate future
is supporting out-of-core operations in xray using Dask_, a part of the Blaze_
project. For a preview of using Dask with weather data, read
`this blog post`_ by Matthew Rocklin. See :issue:`328` for more details.

v0.3.2 (23 December, 2014)
--------------------------

This release focused on bug-fixes, speedups and resolving some niggling
inconsistencies.

There are a few cases where the behavior of xray differs from the previous
version. However, I expect that in almost all cases your code will continue to
run unmodified.

.. warning::

    xray now requires pandas v0.15.0 or later. This was necessary for
    supporting TimedeltaIndex without too many painful hacks.

Backwards incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Arrays of :py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects are now automatically cast to
  ``datetime64[ns]`` arrays when stored in an xray object, using machinery
  borrowed from pandas:

  .. ipython:: python

      from datetime import datetime
      xray.Dataset({'t': [datetime(2000, 1, 1)]})

- xray now has support (including serialization to netCDF) for
  :py:class:`~pandas.TimedeltaIndex`. :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` objects
  are thus accordingly cast to ``timedelta64[ns]`` objects when appropriate.
- Masked arrays are now properly coerced to use ``NaN`` as a sentinel value
  (:issue:`259`).

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Due to popular demand, we have added experimental attribute style access as
  a shortcut for dataset variables, coordinates and attributes:

  .. ipython:: python

     ds = xray.Dataset({'tmin': ([], 25, {'units': 'celcius'})})
     ds.tmin.units

  Tab-completion for these variables should work in editors such as IPython.
  However, setting variables or attributes in this fashion is not yet
  supported because there are some unresolved ambiguities (:issue:`300`).
- You can now use a dictionary for indexing with labeled dimensions. This
  provides a safe way to do assignment with labeled dimensions:

  .. ipython:: python

      array = xray.DataArray(np.zeros(5), dims=['x'])
      array[dict(x=slice(3))] = 1
      array

- Non-index coordinates can now be faithfully written to and restored from
  netCDF files. This is done according to CF conventions when possible by
  using the ``coordinates`` attribute on a data variable. When not possible,
  xray defines a global ``coordinates`` attribute.
- Preliminary support for converting ``xray.DataArray`` objects to and from
  CDAT_ ``cdms2`` variables.
- We sped up any operation that involves creating a new Dataset or DataArray
  (e.g., indexing, aggregation, arithmetic) by a factor of 30 to 50%. The full
  speed up requires cyordereddict_ to be installed.

.. _CDAT: http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/
.. _cyordereddict: https://github.com/shoyer/cyordereddict

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix for ``to_dataframe()`` with 0d string/object coordinates (:issue:`287`)
- Fix for ``to_netcdf`` with 0d string variable (:issue:`284`)
- Fix writing datetime64 arrays to netcdf if NaT is present (:issue:`270`)
- Fix align silently upcasts data arrays when NaNs are inserted (:issue:`264`)

Future plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- I am contemplating switching to the terms "coordinate variables" and "data
  variables" instead of the (currently used) "coordinates" and "variables",
  following their use in `CF Conventions`_ (:issue:`293`). This would mostly
  have implications for the documentation, but I would also change the
  ``Dataset`` attribute ``vars`` to ``data``.
- I no longer certain that automatic label alignment for arithmetic would be a
  good idea for xray -- it is a feature from pandas that I have not missed
  (:issue:`186`).
- The main API breakage that I *do* anticipate in the next release is finally
  making all aggregation operations skip missing values by default
  (:issue:`130`). I'm pretty sick of writing ``ds.reduce(np.nanmean, 'time')``.
- The next version of xray (0.4) will remove deprecated features and aliases
  whose use currently raises a warning.

If you have opinions about any of these anticipated changes, I would love to
hear them -- please add a note to any of the referenced GitHub issues.

.. _CF Conventions: http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html

v0.3.1 (22 October, 2014)
-------------------------

This is mostly a bug-fix release to make xray compatible with the latest
release of pandas (v0.15).

We added several features to better support working with missing values and
exporting xray objects to pandas. We also reorganized the internal API for
serializing and deserializing datasets, but this change should be almost
entirely transparent to users.

Other than breaking the experimental DataStore API, there should be no
backwards incompatible changes.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.count` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.dropna`
  methods, copied from pandas, for working with missing values (:issue:`247`,
  :issue:`58`).
- Added :py:meth:`DataArray.to_pandas <xray.DataArray.to_pandas>` for
  converting a data array into the pandas object with the same dimensionality
  (1D to Series, 2D to DataFrame, etc.) (:issue:`255`).
- Support for reading gzipped netCDF3 files (:issue:`239`).
- Reduced memory usage when writing netCDF files (:issue:`251`).
- 'missing_value' is now supported as an alias for the '_FillValue' attribute
  on netCDF variables (:issue:`245`).
- Trivial indexes, equivalent to ``range(n)`` where ``n`` is the length of the
  dimension, are no longer written to disk (:issue:`245`).

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Compatibility fixes for pandas v0.15 (:issue:`262`).
- Fixes for display and indexing of ``NaT`` (not-a-time) (:issue:`238`,
  :issue:`240`)
- Fix slicing by label was an argument is a data array (:issue:`250`).
- Test data is now shipped with the source distribution (:issue:`253`).
- Ensure order does not matter when doing arithmetic with scalar data arrays
  (:issue:`254`).
- Order of dimensions preserved with ``DataArray.to_dataframe`` (:issue:`260`).

v0.3 (21 September 2014)
------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Revamped coordinates**: "coordinates" now refer to all arrays that are not
  used to index a dimension. Coordinates are intended to allow for keeping track
  of arrays of metadata that describe the grid on which the points in "variable"
  arrays lie. They are preserved (when unambiguous) even though mathematical
  operations.
- **Dataset math** :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects now support all arithmetic
  operations directly. Dataset-array operations map across all dataset
  variables; dataset-dataset operations act on each pair of variables with the
  same name.
- **GroupBy math**: This provides a convenient shortcut for normalizing by the
  average value of a group.
- The dataset ``__repr__`` method has been entirely overhauled; dataset
  objects now show their values when printed.
- You can now index a dataset with a list of variables to return a new dataset:
  ``ds[['foo', 'bar']]``.

Backwards incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Dataset.__eq__`` and ``Dataset.__ne__`` are now element-wise operations
  instead of comparing all values to obtain a single boolean. Use the method
  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.equals` instead.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Dataset.noncoords`` is deprecated: use ``Dataset.vars`` instead.
- ``Dataset.select_vars`` deprecated: index a ``Dataset`` with a list of
  variable names instead.
- ``DataArray.select_vars`` and ``DataArray.drop_vars`` deprecated: use
  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.reset_coords` instead.

v0.2 (14 August 2014)
---------------------

This is major release that includes some new features and quite a few bug
fixes. Here are the highlights:

- There is now a direct constructor for ``DataArray`` objects, which makes it
  possible to create a DataArray without using a Dataset. This is highlighted
  in the refreshed :doc:`tutorial`.
- You can perform aggregation operations like ``mean`` directly on
  :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects, thanks to Joe Hamman. These aggregation
  methods also worked on grouped datasets.
- xray now works on Python 2.6, thanks to Anna Kuznetsova.
- A number of methods and attributes were given more sensible (usually shorter)
  names: ``labeled`` -> ``sel``,  ``indexed`` -> ``isel``, ``select`` ->
  ``select_vars``, ``unselect`` -> ``drop_vars``, ``dimensions`` -> ``dims``,
  ``coordinates`` -> ``coords``, ``attributes`` -> ``attrs``.
- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load_data` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.close`
  methods for datasets facilitate lower level of control of data loaded from
  disk.

v0.1.1 (20 May 2014)
--------------------

xray 0.1.1 is a bug-fix release that includes changes that should be almost
entirely backwards compatible with v0.1:

- Python 3 support (:issue:`53`)
- Required numpy version relaxed to 1.7 (:issue:`129`)
- Return numpy.datetime64 arrays for non-standard calendars (:issue:`126`)
- Support for opening datasets associated with NetCDF4 groups (:issue:`127`)
- Bug-fixes for concatenating datetime arrays (:issue:`134`)

Special thanks to new contributors Thomas Kluyver, Joe Hamman and Alistair
Miles.

v0.1 (2 May 2014)
-----------------

Initial release.
