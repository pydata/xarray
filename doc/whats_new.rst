xray 0.1.1 is a bug-fix release that includes changes that should be almost
entirely backwards compatible with v0.1:

- Python 3 support (:issue:`53`)
- Required numpy version relaxed to 1.7 (:issue:`129`)
- Return numpy.datetime64 arrays for non-standard calendars (:issue:`126`)
- Support for opening datasets associated with NetCDF4 groups (:issue:`127`)
- Bug-fixes for concatenating datetime arrays (:issue:`134`)

Special thanks to new contributors Thomas Kluyver, Joe Hamman and Alistair
