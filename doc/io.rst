Serialization and IO
====================

xray supports direct serialization and IO to several file formats. For more
options, consider exporting your objects to pandas (see the preceding section)
and using its broad range of `IO tools`__.

__ http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import xray
    np.random.seed(123456)

Pickle
------

The simplest way to serialize an xray object is to use Python's built-in pickle
module:

.. ipython:: python

    import cPickle as pickle

    ds = xray.Dataset({'foo': (('x', 'y'), np.random.rand(4, 5))},
                      coords={'x': [10, 20, 30, 40],
                              'y': pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=5),
                              'z': ('x', list('abcd'))})

    # use the highest protocol (-1) because it is way faster than the default
    # text based pickle format
    pkl = pickle.dumps(ds, protocol=-1)

    pickle.loads(pkl)

Pickle support is important because it doesn't require any external libraries
and lets you use xray objects with Python modules like
:py:mod:`multiprocessing`. However, there are two important caveats:

1. To simplify serialization, xray's support for pickle currently loads all
   array values into memory before dumping an object. This means it is not
   suitable for serializing datasets too big to load into memory (e.g., from
   netCDF or OPeNDAP).
2. Pickle will only work as long as the internal data structure of xray objects
   remains unchanged. Because the internal design of xray is still being
   refined, we make no guarantees (at this point) that objects pickled with
   this version of xray will work in future versions.

netCDF
------

Currently, the only disk based serialization format that xray directly supports
is `netCDF`__. netCDF is a file format for fully self-described datasets that
is widely used in the geosciences and supported on almost all platforms. We use
netCDF because xray was based on the netCDF data model, so netCDF files on disk
directly correspond to :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects. Recent versions
netCDF are based on the even more widely used HDF5 file-format.

__ http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Reading and writing netCDF files with xray requires the
`netCDF4-Python`__ library or scipy to be installed.

__ https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python

We can save a Dataset to disk using the
:py:attr:`Dataset.to_netcdf <xray.Dataset.to_netcdf>` method:

.. use verbatim because readthedocs doesn't have netCDF4 support

.. ipython:: python

    ds.to_netcdf('saved_on_disk.nc')

By default, the file is saved as netCDF4 (assuming netCDF4-Python is
installed). You can control the format and engine used to write the file with
the ``format`` and ``engine`` arguments.

We can load netCDF files to create a new Dataset using
:py:func:`~xray.open_dataset`:

.. ipython:: python

    ds_disk = xray.open_dataset('saved_on_disk.nc')
    ds_disk

A dataset can also be loaded or written to a specific group within a netCDF
file. To load from a group, pass a ``group`` keyword argument to the
``open_dataset`` function. The group can be specified as a path-like
string, e.g., to access subgroup 'bar' within group 'foo' pass
'/foo/bar' as the ``group`` argument. When writing multiple groups in one file,
pass ``mode='a'`` to ``to_netcdf`` to ensure that each call does not delete the
file.

Data is loaded lazily from netCDF files. You can manipulate, slice and subset
Dataset and DataArray objects, and no array values are loaded into memory until
you try to perform some sort of actual computation. For an example of how these
lazy arrays work, see the OPeNDAP section below.

It is important to note that when you modify values of a Dataset, even one
linked to files on disk, only the in-memory copy you are manipulating in xray
is modified: the original file on disk is never touched.

.. tip::

    xray's lazy loading of remote or on-disk datasets is often but not always
    desirable. Before performing computationally intense operations, it is
    usually a good idea to load a dataset entirely into memory by invoking the
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load` method.

Datasets have a :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.close` method to close the associated
netCDF file. However, it's often cleaner to use a ``with`` statement:

.. ipython:: python

    # this automatically closes the dataset after use
    with xray.open_dataset('saved_on_disk.nc') as ds:
        print(ds.keys())

.. note::

    Although xray provides reasonable support for incremental reads of files on
    disk, it does not yet support incremental writes, which is important for
    dealing with datasets that do not fit into memory. This is a significant
    shortcoming that we hope to resolve (:issue:`199`) by adding the ability to
    create ``Dataset`` objects directly linked to a netCDF file on disk.

NetCDF files follow some conventions for encoding datetime arrays (as numbers
with a "units" attribute) and for packing and unpacking data (as
described by the "scale_factor" and "_FillValue" attributes). If the argument
``decode_cf=True`` (default) is given to ``open_dataset``, xray will attempt
to automatically decode the values in the netCDF objects according to
`CF conventions`_. Sometimes this will fail, for example, if a variable
has an invalid "units" or "calendar" attribute. For these cases, you can
turn this decoding off manually.

.. _CF conventions: http://cfconventions.org/

You can view this encoding information and control the details of how xray
serializes objects, by viewing and manipulating the
:py:attr:`DataArray.encoding <xray.DataArray.encoding>` attribute:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: ds_disk['y'].encoding
    Out[1]:
    {'calendar': u'proleptic_gregorian',
     'chunksizes': None,
     'complevel': 0,
     'contiguous': True,
     'dtype': dtype('float64'),
     'fletcher32': False,
     'least_significant_digit': None,
     'shuffle': False,
     'source': 'saved_on_disk.nc',
     'units': u'days since 2000-01-01 00:00:00',
     'zlib': False}

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    ds_disk.close()
    import os
    os.remove('saved_on_disk.nc')

OPeNDAP
-------

xray includes support for `OPeNDAP`__ (via the netCDF4 library or Pydap), which
lets us access large datasets over HTTP.

__ http://www.opendap.org/

For example, we can open a connection to GBs of weather data produced by the
`PRISM`__ project, and hosted by `IRI`__ at Columbia:

__ http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/
__ http://iri.columbia.edu/

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [3]: remote_data = xray.open_dataset(
       ...:     'http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.OSU/.PRISM/.monthly/dods',
       ...:     decode_times=False)

    In [4]: remote_data
    Out[4]:

.. TODO: update this example to show off decode_cf

.. note::

    Like many real-world datasets, this dataset does not entirely follow
    `CF conventions`_. Unexpected formats will usually cause xray's automatic
    decoding to fail. The way to work around this is to either set
    ``decode_cf=False`` in ``open_dataset`` to turn off all use of CF
    conventions, or by only disabling the troublesome parser.
    In this case, we set ``decode_times=False`` because the time axis here
    provides the calendar attribute in a format that xray does not expect
    (the integer ``360`` instead of a string like ``'360_day'``).


We can select and slice this data any number of times, and nothing is loaded
over the network until we look at particular values:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [4]: tmax = remote_data['tmax'][:500, ::3, ::3]

    In [5]: tmax
    Out[5]:
    <xray.DataArray 'tmax' (T: 500, Y: 207, X: 469)>

        expires: 1375315200

Finally, let's plot a small subset with matplotlib:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [6]: tmax_ss = tmax[0]

    In [8]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    In [10]: plt.figure(figsize=(9, 5))

    In [11]: plt.gca().patch.set_color('0')

    In [12]: plt.contourf(tmax_ss['X'], tmax_ss['Y'], tmax_ss.values, 20,
       ....:     cmap='RdBu_r')

    In [113]: plt.colorbar(label='tmax (deg C)')

.. image:: _static/opendap-prism-tmax.png

.. note::

    We do hope to eventually add plotting methods to xray to make this easier
    (:issue:`185`).

.. _combining multiple files:

Combining multiple files
------------------------

NetCDF files are often encountered in collections, e.g., with different files
corresponding to different model runs. xray can straightforwardly combine such
files into a single Dataset by making use of :py:func:`~xray.concat`.

.. note::

    Version 0.5 includes experimental support for manipulating datasets that
    don't fit into memory with dask_. If you have dask installed, you can open
    multiple files simultaneously using :py:func:`~xray.open_mfdataset`::

        xray.open_mfdataset('my/files/*.nc')

    This function will automatically concatenate and merge dataset into one in
    the simple cases that it understands (see :py:func:`~xray.auto_combine`
    for the full disclaimer). For more on using dask arrays with xray,
    see :doc:`dask`.

.. _dask: http://dask.pydata.org

For example, here's how we could approximate ``MFDataset`` from the netCDF4
library::

    from glob import glob
    import xray

    def read_netcdfs(files, dim):
        # glob expands paths with * to a list of files, like the unix shell
        paths = sorted(glob(files))
        datasets = [xray.open_dataset(p) for p in paths]
        combined = xray.concat(dataset, dim)
        return combined

    read_netcdfs('/all/my/files/*.nc', dim='time')

This function will work in many cases, but it's not very robust. First, it
never closes files, which means it will fail one you need to load more than
a few thousands file. Second, it assumes that you want all the data from each
file and that it can all fit into memory. In many situations, you only need
a small subset or an aggregated summary of the data from each file.

Here's a slightly more sophisticated example of how to remedy these
deficiencies::

    def read_netcdfs(files, dim, transform_func=None):
        def process_one_path(path):
            # use a context manager, to ensure the file gets closed after use
            with xray.open_dataset(path) as ds:
                # transform_func should do some sort of selection or
                # aggregation
                if transform_func is not None:
                    ds = transform_func(ds)
                # load all data from the transformed dataset, to ensure we can
                # use it after closing each original file
                ds.load()
                return ds

        paths = sorted(glob(files))
        datasets = [process_one_path(p) for p in paths]
        xray.concat(dataset, dim)

    # here we suppose we only care about the combined mean of each file;
    # you might also use indexing operations like .sel to subset datasets
    read_netcdfs('/all/my/files/*.nc', dim='time',
                 transform_func=lambda ds: ds.mean())

This pattern works well and is very robust. We've used similar code to process
tens of thousands of files constituting 100s of GB of data.
