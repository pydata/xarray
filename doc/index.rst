xarray: N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python
=================================================

**xarray** (formerly **xray**) is an open source project and Python package
that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple,
efficient, and fun!

Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and
attributes on top of raw NumPy_-like arrays, which allows for a more
intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience.
The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions
for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

Xarray is inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas_, the popular data
analysis package focused on labelled tabular data.
It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF_ files, which were the
source of xarray's data model, and integrates tightly with dask_ for parallel
computing.

History
-------

xarray is an evolution of an internal tool developed at `The Climate
Corporation`__. It was originally written by Climate Corp researchers Stephan
Hoyer, Alex Kleeman and Eugene Brevdo and was released as open source in
May 2014. The project was renamed from "xray" in January 2016. Xarray became a
fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS_ in August 2018.
