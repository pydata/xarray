xray: extended arrays for working with scientific datasets in Python
====================================================================

**xray** is a Python package for working with aligned sets of
homogeneous, n-dimensional arrays. It implements flexible array
operations and dataset manipulation for in-memory datasets within the
`Common Data
Model <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/CDM/>`__
widely used for self-describing scientific data (e.g., the
`NetCDF <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`__ file
format).

Why xray?
---------

Adding dimensions names and coordinate values to numpy's
`ndarray <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>`__
makes many powerful array operations possible:

-  Apply operations over dimensions by name: ``x.sum('time')``.
-  Select values by label instead of integer location:
   ``x.loc['2014-01-01']`` or ``x.labeled(time='2014-01-01')``.
-  Mathematical operations (e.g., ``x - y``) vectorize across multiple
   dimensions (known in numpy as "broadcasting") based on dimension
   names, regardless of their original order.
-  Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:
   ``x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()``.
-  Database like aligment based on coordinate labels that smoothly
   handles missing values: ``x, y = xray.align(x, y, join='outer')``.
-  Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:
   ``x.attrs``.

**xray** aims to provide a data analysis toolkit as powerful as
`pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ but designed for working with
homogeneous N-dimensional arrays instead of tabular data. Indeed, much
of its design and internal functionality (in particular, fast indexing)
is shamelessly borrowed from pandas.

Because **xray** implements the same data model as the NetCDF file
format, xray datasets have a natural and portable serialization format.
But it's also easy to robustly convert an xray ``DataArray`` to and from
a numpy ``ndarray`` or a pandas ``DataFrame`` or ``Series``, providing
compatibility with the full `PyData ecosystem <http://pydata.org/>`__.

contribution. If you have questions or more general feedback about xray, feel

.. note ::

    **xray** is still very new -- it is only a few months old. Although we will
    make a best effort to maintain the current API, it is likely that the API
    will change in future versions as xray matures. Some changes are already
    anticipated, as called out in the `Tutorial <tutorial>`_ and the project
    `README <http://github.com/xray/xray>`__.
