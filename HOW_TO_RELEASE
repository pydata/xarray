How to issue an xarray release in 15 easy steps

Time required: about an hour.

 1. Ensure your master branch is synced to upstream:
       git pull upstream master
 2. Look over whats-new.rst and the docs. Make sure "What's New" is complete
    (check the date!) and add a brief summary note describing the release at the
    top.
 3. Update the version in setup.py and switch to `ISRELEASED = True`.
 4. If you have any doubts, run the full test suite one final time!
      py.test
 5. On the master branch, commit the release in git:
      git commit -a -m 'Release v0.X.Y'
 6. Tag the release:
      git tag -a v0.X.Y -m 'v0.X.Y'
 7. Build source and binary wheels for pypi:
      python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist
 8. Use twine to register and upload the release on pypi. Be careful, you can't
    take this back!
      twine register dist/xarray-0.X.Y-py2.py3-none-any.whl
      twine upload dist/xarray-0.X.Y*
    You will need to be listed as a package owner at
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xarray for this to work.
 9. Push your changes to master:
      git push upstream master
      git push upstream --tags
 9. Update the stable branch (used by ReadTheDocs) and switch back to master:
      git checkout stable
      git rebase master
      git push upstream stable
      git checkout master
    We also update the stable branch with `git cherrypick` for documentation
    only fixes that apply the current released version.
10. Revert ISRELEASED in setup.py back to False. Don't change the version
    number: in normal development, we keep the version number in setup.py as the
    last released version.
11. Commit your changes and push to master again:
      git commit -a -m 'Revert to dev version'
      git push upstream master
    You're done pushing to master!
12. Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
    https://github.com/pydata/xarray/releases and paste in the latest from
    whats-new.rst.
13. Update the docs. Login to https://readthedocs.org/projects/xray/versions/
    and switch your new release tag (at the bottom) from "Inactive" to "Active".
    It should now build automatically.
14. Update conda-forge. Clone https://github.com/conda-forge/xarray-feedstock
    and update the version number and sha256 in meta.yaml. (On OS X, you can
    calculate sha256 with `shasum -a 256 xarray-0.X.Y.tar.gz`). Submit a pull
    request (and merge it, once CI passes).
15. Issue the release announcement! For bug fix releases, I usually only email
    xarray@googlegroups.com. For major/feature releases, I will email a broader
    list (no more than once every 3-6 months):
      pydata@googlegroups.com, xarray@googlegroups.com,
      numpy-discussion@scipy.org, scipy-user@scipy.org,
      pyaos@lists.johnny-lin.com
    Google search will turn up examples of prior release announcements (look for
    "ANN xarray").

Note on version numbering:

We follow a rough approximation of semantic version. Only major releases (0.X.0)
show include breaking changes. Minor releases (0.X.Y) are for bug fixes and
backwards compatible new features, but if a sufficient number of new features
have arrived we will issue a major release even if there are no compatibility
breaks.

Once the project reaches a sufficient level of maturity for a 1.0.0 release, we
intend to follow semantic versioning more strictly.
