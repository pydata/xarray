    Parameters
    ----------
    index : CFTimeIndex
        Index object to be resampled (e.g., CFTimeIndex named 'time').
    freq : xarray.coding.cftime_offsets.BaseCFTimeOffset
        The offset object representing target conversion a.k.a. resampling
        frequency (e.g., 'MS', '2D', 'H', or '3T' with
        coding.cftime_offsets.to_offset() applied to it).
    closed : 'left' or 'right', optional
        Which side of bin interval is closed.
        The default is 'left' for all frequency offsets except for 'M' and 'A',
        which have a default of 'right'.
    label : 'left' or 'right', optional
        Which bin edge label to label bucket with.

        which have a default of 'right'.
    base : int, optional
        For frequencies that evenly subdivide 1 day, the "origin" of the

        range from 0 through 4. Defaults to 0.

        Defines the edge of resampling bins by which original index values will

    Consider the following example.  Let's say you want to downsample the
    time series with the following coordinates to month end frequency:

    CFTimeIndex([2000-01-01 12:00:00, 2000-01-31 12:00:00,

    2000-01-31T12:00:00 (at noon on January 31st), will not be included in the
    month of January.  To account for this, pandas adds a day minus one worth
    of microseconds to the bin edges generated by cftime range, so that we do
    bin the value at noon on January 31st in the January bin.  This results in
    an index with bin edges like the following:

                 2000-02-29 23:59:59], dtype='object')
