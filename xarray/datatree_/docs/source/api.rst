   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree
   DataTree.from_dict
   DataTree.from_dict_nested

Data Contents
-------------

Interface to the data objects (optionally) stored inside a single ``DataTree`` node.
This interface echoes that of ``xarray.Dataset``.

   DataTree.is_hollow

Dictionary Interface
--------------------

``DataTree`` objects also have a dict-like interface mapping keys to either ``xarray.DataArray``s or to child ``DataTree`` nodes.

   DataTree.__setitem__
   DataTree.__delitem__
   DataTree.update
   DataTree.get

   DataTree.keys
   DataTree.values

Tree Manipulation
-----------------

For manipulating, traversing, navigating, or mapping over the tree structure.

   DataTree.filter

Pathlib-like Interface
----------------------

``DataTree`` objects deliberately echo some of the API of `pathlib.PurePath`.

   :toctree: generated/

   DataTree.name
   DataTree.parent
   DataTree.parents
   DataTree.relative_to
