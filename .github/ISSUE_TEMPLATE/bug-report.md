<!-- Please include a self-contained copy-pastable example that generates the issue if possible.

Please be concise with code posted. See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:

- Craft Minimal Bug Reports: http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports
- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve

Bug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.

<!-- Please confirm the guidelines have been followed before posting the issue. -->

- [ ] Minimal example — the example is about as small as possible to show the
  underlying issue in xarray, and doesn't link to external data.
- [ ] Complete example — the example is self-contained, and includes any traceback.
- [ ] Verifiable example — the example copies & pastes into an IPython prompt.
- [ ] New issue — a cursory search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.
