  demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.
- [ ] Complete example — the example is self-contained, including all data and
  the text of any traceback.
- [ ] Verifiable example — the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt, returning
  the result.
- [ ] New issue — a reasonable search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.
